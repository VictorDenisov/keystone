Imports are sorted in alphabetic order.

Every symbol should be imported explicitly or it should be a qualified import.

Symbols in import lists should be sorted in alphabetic order -
first lower case in alphabetic order then upper case in alphabetic order.

If the first word of an import is different from the one above then the should be
an empty line between them.
